# TrashTrack Mobile App

## Overview

TrashTrack is a mobile app designed to help users stay updated on the arrival of the trash truck in their area. This app provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to track the trash truck in real-time and receive notifications based on its estimated arrival time (ETA). Additionally, the app supports user authentication for secure access and allows trash truck drivers to control the tracking feature.

Currently, the app does not involve any hardware but is designed to work with tracking details from the driver’s app. The driver has the option to start or stop the tracking functionality directly from the app. The app is intended for both the users who want to track the trash truck's location and drivers who need to manage the tracking system.
